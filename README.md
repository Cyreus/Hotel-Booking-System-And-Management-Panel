# Hotel Booking

The project consists of a hotel reservation system and an admin panel. The hotel reservation section features a visually appealing interface aimed at the end user. In this system, customers are registered in an MSSQL database. If they already have an existing registration, they can simply log in by indicating that they already have an account, and then proceed to make their reservation quickly and easily.




## Management Panel
To access the admin panel, you can enter the link in down blow. Since it is used only on the local network, a security system or web security wall has not been implemented.

 ```bash
  ---->localhost/Panel
  
 ```
